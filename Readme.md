This is minimal repository to host a webpage with local highcharts demo.

### Requesities:

[highcharts repository]( https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts ) cloned and built

[highcharts utils server]( https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-utils ) cloned and running

in the source code, in index.html replace ip of the utils server with your own. The easy way of getting your IP:
When running the utils server, the first message in the console says on what IP/port each server is running. You want to find the one with the port 3031 with the alias of `code.highcharts.local`.

### Running the app
you can run your app with live server visual studio code extention.
